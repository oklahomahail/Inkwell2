## PHASE 3 ROADMAP – Minimum Lovable Publishing + Visuals (90 days)

### Non-Goals for Phase 3 (explicitly deferred)
- Character relationship graphs (use matrix and cross-refs first)
- Ambient sound
- Semantic search and embeddings
- Branching version control
- Public plugin architecture
- Community features and real-time collaboration
- Local/offline AI models

### P0 – Weeks 1–4 (Publication-Ready Core)
- **Focus Mode polish** – Typewriter line centering, sprint timers, zen UI, per-project persistence
- **Full-text search** – Local inverted index across title, scene text, notes, characters; scoped filters; highlighted snippets  
- **Professional export** – EPUB v1 with metadata/TOC/scene separators; DOCX and PDF templates for Standard Manuscript and Proof/ARC

**P0 Success Criteria:**
- Focus Mode used in 60% of sessions; no cursor jumps or layout shifts
- p50 search latency < 50 ms on 150k-word projects
- Typical agent submission requires zero manual reformatting

### ✅ P1 – Weeks 5–8 (Visual Story Management) **[1/3 COMPLETE]**
- **✅ Visual Timeline v1** – Events by date or order with POV, location, tags; inline edit, drag reorder, filters **[COMPLETE]**
- **Corkboard v1** – Scene cards by Act/Chapter; drag reorder; quick add; status and simple color labels
- **Project templates + bulk ops** – Templates for MG novel and Thriller; bulk move/merge/rename; status tags

**P1 Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Users answer "When did X happen and who knew what?" inside Timeline **[ACHIEVED]**
- 80%+ of reordering happens on Corkboard rather than in the editor
- Bulk ops are undoable and logged

### P2 – Weeks 9–12 (Performance & Publishing)
- **Large-project performance pass** – Virtualize lists, lazy-load long scenes, cache search indexes
- **Beta Reader Pack** – One-click EPUB + DOCX + styled PDF + character list; import feedback as scene-anchored notes

**P2 Success Criteria:**
- Smooth typing at 60 fps on 150k words, desktop and iPad Safari
- Feedback imports map to scene and text range without duplication

## Phase 3 Quick Wins

### Half-day features (4–6 hours)
```typescript
const focusModeEnhancements = {
  typewriterMode: true,     // Center current line
  writingSprints: true,     // Timers + word targets
  zenMode: true,            // Auto-hiding controls
  keyboardShortcuts: true,  // F11, Esc, Ctrl+Shift+S
  sprintAnalytics: true     // WPM, completion rates
};

const searchFeatures = {
  fullTextSearch: true,     // Fast local index + filters
  characterMentions: true,  // Find character appearances
  tagFilters: true          // Project/scene/tag scoping
};
```

### Weekend projects (1–2 days)
```typescript
const visualTools = {
  timelineView: true,       // ✅ COMPLETE - Events by order/date with POV lanes
  corkboardView: true,      // Scene cards with drag-reorder
  storyMap: true            // Visual story organization
};

const exportEnhancements = {
  epubFrontMatter: true,    // Metadata, cover, clean TOC
  proofTemplate: true       // Styled PDF/DOCX proof template
};

const betaReader = {

- "Integrate Timeline events with the new search indexing system."

### Advanced feature requests  
- "Create a Corkboard that updates underlying scene order and supports keyboard reordering."
- "Implement advanced Focus Mode features with persistence and sprint timers."
- "Add professional EPUB export with clean TOC and scene separators using our shared style tokens."
- "Build search functionality that indexes Timeline events alongside scenes and characters."

### Complex system development
- "Build a Beta Reader Pack and import pipeline that maps feedback to scene and range."
- "Harden large-project performance via virtualization, lazy-loading, and index caching."
- "Create export templates that pull metadata from Timeline events and Story Architect data."

## Top 3 Recommended Phase 3 Features (Updated)

1. **Focus Mode Advanced** – Typewriter, sprints, zen, persistence
2. **Full-Text Search** – Fast local index with Timeline integration  
3. **Corkboard v1** – Visual scene organization with drag-reorder

*Note: Timeline v1 is complete, enabling the next visual management tool (Corkboard) to build on the same patterns.*

## CURRENT STATUS: PHASE 3 P0 IN PROGRESS – TIMELINE FOUNDATION COMPLETE

Inkwell now combines full AI story generation, intelligent consistency analysis, a distraction-free Focus Mode baseline, **visual Timeline management**, robust backups, and production-ready deployment. 

**Recent Achievement:** Visual Timeline v1 with POV lanes, event filtering, and Story Architect integration enables authors to answer "when did X happen and who knew what?" – a core professional writing workflow.

**Next Focus:** Complete remaining P0 features (Focus Mode polish, Search, Professional Export) to achieve publication-ready milestone, then build Corkboard v1 using the same visual management patterns established by Timeline.
