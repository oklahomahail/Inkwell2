Authentication is handled through Supabase, with the following flows:

- Sign in (email/password or magic link)
- Sign up (with email verification)
- Password reset
- Account recovery

## Features

- Chapter & scene tracker with reordering
- Character profiles (bios, arcs, relationships)
- Clue tracker (planting → resolution mapping)
- Writing progress: word count, streaks, goals
- Story notes with tagging
- Timeline conflict checker
- Theme & motif tracker
- Offline-first (IndexedDB), instant startup
- Dark mode, keyboard shortcuts, command palette
- Claude/OpenAI assistant panel (generate or critique)
- Export/import project data

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in required VITE_* values
pnpm dev
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev        # start app
pnpm test       # unit tests
pnpm typecheck  # TS
pnpm lint       # eslint

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **Profile Isolation**: Complete data separation with prefixed storage keys
- **Feature Flag Driven**: All major features controlled by toggles
- **AI-First Design**: Mock and production AI services with circuit breakers
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally with optional cloud AI
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline with graceful AI degradation
- **Accessible by Design**: WCAG AA compliant throughout

## Getting Started for Contributors

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oklahomahail/Inkwell2.git
cd Inkwell2

# 2. Install dependencies (pnpm required)
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:5173
```

### First Time Setup Workflow

When you first open Inkwell, you'll go through a quick setup:

1. **Create Your First Profile** — Choose a name and color for your workspace
2. **Choose Your Experience Level** — Select Beginner Mode (recommended) or Pro Mode
3. **Optional Tour** — Take a 60-90 second tour of the main features
4. **Start Writing** — Either create a blank project or use the guided First Draft Path

### Developer Workflow

```bash
# Development commands
pnpm dev           # Start with hot reload
pnpm build         # Production build
pnpm preview       # Test production build
pnpm test          # Run test suite in watch mode

# Code quality
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript compilation check
pnpm lint          # ESLint (strict mode)
pnpm lint:fix      # Auto-fix ESLint issues
pnpm test:run      # Run all tests once
pnpm test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### Understanding the Profile System

Inkwell uses a multi-profile system where each "profile" is an isolated workspace:

- **URLs**: All routes are profile-scoped: `/p/{profileId}/dashboard`
- **Data**: Each profile has its own database with prefixed keys
- **Features**: Profiles can have different feature flag settings (Beginner vs Pro)
- **Tours**: Tutorial progress is tracked per profile

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Create Test Profiles** — Use different profiles to test isolation
2. **Test Both Modes** — Switch between Beginner and Pro modes
3. **Test the Onboarding** — Clear your localStorage to test first-run experience
4. **Run the Test Suite** — Ensure all 200+ tests still pass

### Key Development Areas

- **`src/components/`** — React components organized by feature
- **`src/services/`** — Business logic and external integrations
- **`src/features/`** — Self-contained feature modules (e.g., Plot Boards)
- **`docs/dev/`** — Developer documentation for each system
