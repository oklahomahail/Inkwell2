## Overview

Inkwell helps writers plan, draft, and revise with structure. It blends creative flow with organized systems: chapters and scenes, character bibles, clue tracking, timeline checks, progress analytics, and AI-assisted drafting.

## Authentication

Inkwell is a single-user application with authentication through Supabase:

- Email/Password authentication
- Magic link authentication (passwordless email)

Authentication flows supported:

- Sign in (email/password or magic link)
- Sign up (with email verification)
- Password reset
- Account recovery

Each user has a single workspace with all their projects, chapters, characters, and settings.

### Authentication Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with authentication:

- For email delivery problems during sign-up or password reset, see [Supabase Auth Email Troubleshooting](/docs/SUPABASE_AUTH_EMAIL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- For general auth flow issues, see [Auth Troubleshooting Guide](./AUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md) (updated October 2025)
- For deployment settings, see [Supabase Auth Deployment Checklist](/docs/SUPABASE_AUTH_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) (updated October 2025)
- For React hooks issues in auth components, see [React Hooks Safety Guidelines](/docs/HOOKS_SAFETY.md)
- For details on hardened authentication flow, see [Supabase Auth Checklist](./SUPABASE_AUTH_CHECKLIST.md) (updated October 2025)
- For MutationObserver safety implementations, see [MutationObserver Guards](/docs/MUTATION_OBSERVER_GUARDS.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in required VITE_* values
pnpm dev
```

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev        # start app
pnpm test       # unit tests
pnpm typecheck  # TS
pnpm lint       # eslint
pnpm build      # production build
pnpm tree:update # regenerate file tree in README
```

## Configuration

| Key                    | Required | Purpose                     |
| ---------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| VITE_SUPABASE_URL      | yes      | Supabase API URL            |
| VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY | yes      | Supabase anonymous API key  |
| VITE_BASE_URL          | yes      | App origin for redirects    |
| VITE_SENTRY_DSN        | no       | Error reporting (prod only) |

See [/docs/ops/01-deploy.md](/docs/ops/01-deploy.md) and [/docs/ops/03-secrets.md](/docs/ops/03-secrets.md) for full guidance.

## Architecture

Client-side React + Vite, local storage via IndexedDB, auth via Supabase, feature-flagged analytics, and optional AI integrations.

Single-user model: each authenticated user has one workspace with all their data stored locally in IndexedDB.

```
React (Vite)
 ├─ UI (Tailwind)
 ├─ State (Context + hooks)
 ├─ Storage (IndexedDB - user-scoped)
 ├─ Features (chapters, characters, clues, timeline)
 ├─ AI (Claude/OpenAI adapter)
└─ Auth (Supabase - single user)
```

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **Profile Isolation**: Complete data separation with prefixed storage keys
- **Feature Flag Driven**: All major features controlled by toggles
- **AI-First Design**: Mock and production AI services with circuit breakers
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally with optional cloud AI
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline with graceful AI degradation
- **Accessible by Design**: WCAG AA compliant throughout

## Getting Started for Contributors

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oklahomahail/Inkwell2.git
cd Inkwell2

# 2. Install dependencies (pnpm required)
pnpm install

# 3. Start the development server
pnpm dev

# 4. Open http://localhost:5173
```

### First Time Setup Workflow

When you first open Inkwell, you'll go through a quick setup:

1. **Create Your First Profile** — Choose a name and color for your workspace
2. **Choose Your Experience Level** — Select Beginner Mode (recommended) or Pro Mode
3. **Optional Tour** — Take a 60-90 second tour of the main features
4. **Start Writing** — Either create a blank project or use the guided First Draft Path

### Developer Workflow

```bash
# Development commands
pnpm dev           # Start with hot reload
pnpm build         # Production build
pnpm preview       # Test production build
pnpm test          # Run test suite in watch mode

# Code quality
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript compilation check
pnpm lint          # ESLint (strict mode)
pnpm lint:fix      # Auto-fix ESLint issues
pnpm test:run      # Run all tests once
pnpm test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### Understanding the Profile System

Inkwell uses a multi-profile system where each "profile" is an isolated workspace:

- **URLs**: All routes are profile-scoped: `/p/{profileId}/dashboard`
- **Data**: Each profile has its own database with prefixed keys
- **Features**: Profiles can have different feature flag settings (Beginner vs Pro)
- **Tours**: Tutorial progress is tracked per profile

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Create Test Profiles** — Use different profiles to test isolation
2. **Test Both Modes** — Switch between Beginner and Pro modes
3. **Test the Onboarding** — Clear your localStorage to test first-run experience
4. **Run the Test Suite** — Ensure all 598 tests still pass (✅ 72.31% coverage)
5. **Run Coverage Reports** — Use `pnpm test:coverage` to verify your changes maintain coverage

See **[Testing Guide](docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md)** for comprehensive testing patterns and best practices.

### Key Development Areas

- **`src/components/`** — React components organized by feature
- **`src/services/`** — Business logic and external integrations
- **`src/features/`** — Self-contained feature modules (e.g., Plot Boards)
- **`docs/dev/`** — Developer documentation for each system
