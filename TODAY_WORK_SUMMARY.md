## ⚠️ **Not Completed Today (Remaining from Phase 2)**

### Phase 2 - Story Architect Mode

**Status**: 🔄 **PARTIALLY PLANNED BUT NOT STARTED**

#### Remaining Components:

1. **Story Architect Service** (`storyArchitectService.ts`)
   - Scene outline editing and management
   - Story structure templates (3-act, hero's journey, etc.)
   - Cross-session state restoration
   - Template-based project initialization

2. **Story Architect UI Components**
   - `StoryOutlineEditor.tsx` - Interactive outline editing interface
   - `TemplateSelector.tsx` - Story structure template selection
   - `ArchitectPanel.tsx` - Main story architect interface
   - `OutlineVisualization.tsx` - Visual story structure representation

3. **Template System**
   - Predefined story templates with placeholder scenes
   - Template customization and user template creation
   - Template import/export functionality
   - Genre-specific templates (mystery, romance, sci-fi, etc.)

4. **Advanced Integration Features**
