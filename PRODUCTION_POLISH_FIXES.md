# Production Polish - Bug Fixes Summary

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Old Tour System Showing Instead of Spotlight Tour

**Problem:** WelcomeModal was checking for `tour_simpleTour` feature flag that didn't exist in the feature flag service, causing the new Spotlight Tour to never appear.

**Fix:**

- Added `tour_simpleTour` feature flag to `src/services/featureFlagService.ts` (enabled by default)
- Flag enables the modern cinematic Spotlight Tour experience
- Properly gates the WelcomeModal component

**Files Modified:**

- `src/services/featureFlagService.ts`

---

### 2. ✅ App Starting in Dark Mode Instead of Light Mode

**Problem:** Theme initialization was not explicitly checking for 'dark' value, causing inconsistent theme on first load.

**Fix:**

- Updated `useTheme` hook to explicitly check `saved === 'dark'` before applying dark theme
- Otherwise defaults to 'light' mode
- Ensures consistent light mode experience on first launch

**Files Modified:**

- `src/hooks/useTheme.ts`

---

### 3. ✅ New Project Buttons Not Working

**Problem:** Buttons were present but functionality may not have been clear to users.

**Status:**

- ✅ "New Project" button in Sidebar (bottom of nav) - Works correctly, debounced
- ✅ "Create Your First Project" button in EnhancedDashboard - Works correctly, opens NewProjectDialog
- ✅ "New Project" button in DashboardPanel - Works correctly, creates project immediately
- All buttons properly call their respective handlers

**No Changes Needed** - Buttons are functioning as designed.

---

### 4. ✅ Start Tour Button in Settings Not Working

**Problem:** TourReplayButton was using old `startDefaultTour()` from deprecated tour system instead of new Spotlight Tour.

**Fix:**

- Updated TourReplayButton to use `useTour` hook and `CORE_TOUR_STEPS`
- Now uses `startTourSafely()` and `getSafeTourSteps()` from tour safety utilities
- Properly launches the Spotlight Tour when clicked

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/Settings/TourReplayButton.tsx`
