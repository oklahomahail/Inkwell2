# Re-entrant Onboarding Modal Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Fixed

- **Re-entrant modal issue**: "Welcome / Start Tour" modal auto-opened even after clicking "Start Tour" due to re-renders/route changes re-evaluating the show conditions
- **Focus stealing**: Modal would re-open and steal focus from the active tour
- **Missing gate logic**: No single source of truth for onboarding state, leading to multiple competing show/hide conditions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Single Source of Truth - `useOnboardingGate` Hook

Created `src/hooks/useOnboardingGate.ts` with:

- **Persistent state**: `localStorage` for gate status (`pending`, `snoozed`, `dismissed`, `completed`)
- **Session state**: `sessionStorage` for tour active tracking (prevents modal during tours)
- **Hard guard**: `shouldShowModal()` returns `false` while tour is active
- **Snooze logic**: Time-based snoozing with expiration timestamps

```typescript
const { shouldShowModal, setTourActive, snoozeModal, dismissModal } = useOnboardingGate();
```

### 2. Modal Auto-Open Guard

**OnboardingOrchestrator** now uses gate logic instead of tour provider:

```typescript
// Before: Re-entrant issue
if (shouldShowTourPrompt()) {
  /* show modal */
}

// After: Gate protection
if (shouldShowModal()) {
  /* show modal */
}
```

### 3. Tour Start Sequence Fix

**WelcomeModal** tour start handler:

```typescript
const handleStartTour = () => {
  // 1. Prevent re-open during tour
  setTourActive(true);

  // 2. Snooze modal (will be marked complete when tour finishes)
  snoozeModal(7 * 24); // 7 days

  // 3. Close modal first to release focus trap
  onClose();

  // 4. Start tour on next tick so modal is unmounted
  queueMicrotask(() => {
    onStartTour('core-onboarding');
  });
};
```

### 4. Clean Tour Completion

**ProfileTourProvider** updated to clear gate state:

```typescript
const completeTour = useCallback(
  async () => {
    // ... existing tour completion logic ...

    // Clear gate state
    setTourActive(false);
    if (tourState.tourType === 'full-onboarding') {
      completeOnboarding(); // Sets gate to "completed"
    }
  },
  [
    /* deps including setTourActive, completeOnboarding */
  ],
);
```

## Key Features

✅ **Hard Guard**: Modal never auto-opens while `tourActive === true`  
✅ **Focus Trap Protection**: Modal fully unmounts before tour begins  
✅ **State Persistence**: Gate status survives page refreshes and sessions  
✅ **Clean Completion**: Tour completion properly updates gate to "completed"  
✅ **Snooze Support**: "Remind me later" functionality with time-based logic  
✅ **Multiple Dismissal Tracking**: Gate system tracks user dismissal patterns

## Files Modified

1. **`src/hooks/useOnboardingGate.ts`** - New gate system hook
2. **`src/components/Onboarding/WelcomeModal.tsx`** - Updated to use gate logic
3. **`src/components/Onboarding/OnboardingOrchestrator.tsx`** - Gate-based modal control
4. **`src/components/Onboarding/ProfileTourProvider.tsx`** - Gate state cleanup on tour end

## Gate State Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[First Visit] --> B[Gate: "pending"]
    B --> C[shouldShowModal() = true]
    C --> D[Modal Opens]

    D --> E[User Clicks "Start Tour"]
    E --> F[setTourActive(true)]
    F --> G[Gate: "snoozed"]
    G --> H[Modal Closes]
    H --> I[Tour Starts]

    I --> J[Tour Completes]
    J --> K[setTourActive(false)]
    K --> L[Gate: "completed"]

    D --> M[User Clicks "Remind Later"]
    M --> N[Gate: "snoozed" with timestamp]

    D --> O[User Clicks "Never Show"]
    O --> P[Gate: "dismissed"]
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Modal doesn't re-open after clicking "Start Tour"
- [ ] Modal doesn't open during active tour (route changes, re-renders)
- [ ] Tour completion marks gate as "completed"
- [ ] "Remind me later" respects time delay
- [ ] "Don't show again" permanently dismisses
- [ ] Focus trap releases cleanly before tour starts
- [ ] Gate state persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Multiple tour types work correctly

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: localStorage/sessionStorage operations are synchronous and fast
- **No re-renders**: Gate hooks use callbacks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Session cleanup**: `tourActive` automatically clears on session end
