## ‚è∞ **Immediate Next Priorities** (Recommended Order)

1. **Story Architect Service** - Core service implementation
2. **StoryOutlineEditor Component** - Basic outline editing interface
3. **Template System Foundation** - Basic template support
4. **ArchitectPanel Integration** - Main architect interface
5. **Advanced Integration Testing** - Ensure timeline + architect integration

## üìù **Development Notes**

### Architectural Considerations

- Maintain existing service layer patterns established in timeline integration
- Ensure Story Architect features integrate seamlessly with enhanced timeline
- Design for extensibility - new template types should be easy to add
- Consider performance implications for large outlines (100+ scenes)

### User Experience Principles

- Progressive disclosure - don't overwhelm with all features at once
- Maintain familiar patterns from existing timeline interface
- Provide clear migration path from basic writing to architect mode
- Ensure features feel integrated, not bolted-on

### Technical Standards

- Maintain 100% TypeScript coverage
- Comprehensive test suite for all new features
- Performance benchmarks for large projects
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Mobile-responsive design
