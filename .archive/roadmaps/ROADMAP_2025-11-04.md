## Guardrails and Principles

- **Local-first storage** with explicit, user-controlled exports
- **AI is opt-in** and transparent; fallbacks preserve core writing flows
- **Minimal UI pauses**; long operations provide progress and cancel path
- **Privacy-first**: No data sent to cloud without explicit user consent
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant throughout
- **Performance**: Typing latency < 20ms, autosave < 300ms
