# Documentation Pack Integration Guide

This guide walks you through integrating the consolidated documentation pack into your Inkwell repository.

## What You're Getting

### 1. Consolidated Documentation Structure

```
docs/
├── README.md                           # Documentation index
├── brand/
│   ├── BRAND_GUIDE.md                 # Consolidated blue/gold system
│   └── ACCESSIBILITY.md               # A11y guidelines
├── dev/
│   ├── SETUP.md                       # Developer setup guide

├── product/
│   ├── ROADMAP.md                    # Active priorities (moved from root)
│   └── RELEASE.md                    # Release process
└── ops/
    ├── UPTIME_MONITORING.md          # Monitoring and alerting
    └── ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md        # Emergency procedures
```

**Note**: `CHANGELOG.md` stays in root (standard location)

### 2. Clean Root README

A streamlined README.md that points to the organized docs/ structure.

### 3. History-Safe Cleanup Scripts

Three automation scripts using `git mv` to preserve file history:

- `scripts/integrate-docs-pack.sh` - Automated integration helper with rsync
- `scripts/cleanup-docs-all.sh` - Archives legacy docs and reorganizes (with --dry-run)
- `scripts/docs-integration-quickref.sh` - Quick reference card

### 4. Three New Consolidated Feature Docs

✨ **Already created and ready to use**:

- `docs/features/TOUR_SYSTEM.md` - Complete Spotlight tour architecture
- `docs/features/AUTHENTICATION.md` - Supabase auth flows and troubleshooting
- `docs/features/CHAPTER_MANAGEMENT.md` - Chapter/scene organization system

## Integration Steps

### Option A: Automated Integration (Recommended)

If you've downloaded the pack to `~/Downloads/Inkwell md/inkwell-docs-clean/`:

```bash
# From repo root
./scripts/integrate-docs-pack.sh

# Or specify custom path
./scripts/integrate-docs-pack.sh ~/path/to/inkwell-docs-clean
```

This will:

1. Check you're in the repo root (`.git` exists)
2. Backup your current README.md with timestamp
3. Copy the new README and docs/ structure using rsync (handles spaces safely)
4. Update cleanup scripts
5. Make everything executable
6. Verify docs/README.md exists after copy

### Option B: Manual Integration

1. **Copy files in**:

   ```bash
   # From the Downloads folder
   cd ~/Downloads/Inkwell\ md/inkwell-docs-clean/

   # Ensure targets exist
   mkdir -p ~/Developer/inkwell/docs ~/Developer/inkwell/scripts

   # Backup current README with timestamp
   timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   cp ~/Developer/inkwell/README.md ~/Developer/inkwell/README.md.backup.$timestamp

   # Copy new README
   cp README.md ~/Developer/inkwell/

   # Copy docs structure (use rsync for safety)
   rsync -a docs/ ~/Developer/inkwell/docs/

   # Copy/update scripts
   rsync -a scripts/ ~/Developer/inkwell/scripts/
   ```

2. **Make scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Developer/inkwell
   chmod +x scripts/cleanup-docs-*.sh scripts/integrate-docs-pack.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Run the Reorganization

```bash
# Preview changes first (dry-run mode)
./scripts/cleanup-docs-all.sh --dry-run

# Review what will happen, then run for real
./scripts/cleanup-docs-all.sh
```

**What this does**:

- ✅ Checks git working directory is clean (or gracefully handles no HEAD)
- ✅ Prompts for confirmation before making changes
- ✅ Creates `.archive/` directories (summaries, checklists, phase-summaries, migrations)
- ✅ Moves 50+ implementation summaries to `.archive/summaries/`
- ✅ Moves 15+ checklists to `.archive/checklists/`
- ✅ Moves 4 phase summaries to `.archive/phase-summaries/`
- ✅ Reorganizes core docs to new structure
- ✅ Uses `git mv` to preserve file history
- ✅ Counts results and shows summary

**Interactive prompts**:

- Confirms you want to proceed
- Aborts if working directory has uncommitted changes
- Shows progress for each phase

### Step 3: Review Changes

```bash
git status
git diff README.md
ls -la docs/
ls -la docs-archive/
```

### Step 4: Commit Everything

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "docs: reorganize documentation structure and consolidate guides"
```

## What Gets Archived

### Implementation Summaries → `.archive/summaries/`

All the `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_COMPLETE.md`, `*_FIX.md` files like:

- ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- AUTH_FIX_SUMMARY.md

- etc. (50+ files)

### Checklists → `.archive/checklists/`

- PASSWORD_RESET_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
- QA_CHECKLIST.md
- SMOKE_TEST_CHECKLIST.md
- TOUR_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
- etc. (15+ files)

### Phase Summaries → `.archive/phase-summaries/`

Historical phase documentation:

If you need additional consolidations from other scattered docs, let me know.

## Verification

After integration, verify:

```bash
# Check new structure exists
ls -la docs/
ls -la docs/brand/
ls -la docs/dev/
ls -la docs/features/
ls -la docs/user/
ls -la docs/product/

# Check archive was created
ls -la docs-archive/historical/
ls -la docs-archive/legacy/

# Check key docs are in place
cat docs/README.md
cat docs/brand/BRAND_GUIDE.md
cat docs/features/AI_SERVICES.md
```

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to undo:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD  # If not committed
# or
git revert <commit-hash>  # If already committed
```

Your original README is backed up at `README.md.backup`.

## Questions or Issues?

- Scripts not executable? Run `chmod +x scripts/cleanup-docs-*.sh`
- Files not found? Check the path to the inkwell-docs-clean folder
- Want different organization? The scripts are in `scripts/` and easy to customize
