### ðŸ”§ **TypeScript & Developer Experience Improvements**

#### Fixed

- **Trace Logger System** â€” Complete overhaul of tracing infrastructure
  - Resolved "TraceLogger has no call signatures" errors across all plotboards files
  - Updated all trace calls to use proper `trace.log(message, type, level, metadata)` API
  - Fixed test mocks to match the correct trace logger interface
  - Now properly traces performance, user actions, and storage operations

- **Storage Manager Interface** â€” Enhanced storage compatibility
  - Added missing methods: `getItem()`, `setItem()`, `removeItem()`, `getAllKeys()`
  - Created compatibility layer for existing localStorage-style code
  - Resolved "Property does not exist" errors in plotboards storage operations

- **TypeScript Compilation Issues**
  - Fixed duplicate `PlotColumnType` identifier in PlotColumn.tsx
  - Resolved interface mismatches across storage and trace systems
  - Eliminated critical compilation blockers that were preventing builds

- **Test Suite Stability**
  - All plotboards tests now pass (200/200 tests passing)
  - Fixed trace mocking in test files to match updated API
  - Improved test reliability and eliminated flaky test failures

#### Developer Experience

- **Reduced TypeScript Errors** â€” From hundreds of compilation errors to mostly non-critical warnings
- **Improved Logging** â€” Consistent trace logging across all plotboards features with proper categorization
- **Better Error Messages** â€” Clear, actionable error information for debugging
- **Enhanced Type Safety** â€” Proper interfaces and compatibility layers prevent future type mismatches

#### Technical Details

- Updated 7 plotboards files with correct trace logger usage
- Added StorageManager compatibility methods for backward compatibility
- Fixed test mocks across 3 test suites
- Maintained 100% test pass rate throughout cleanup process
- Preserved all existing functionality while improving type safety

### Performance

- No performance impact â€” changes are purely type-safety and developer experience improvements
- Trace logging now provides better performance insights across the application
- Storage operations remain fast with added compatibility layer

### Testing

- **All 200 tests passing** including full plotboards test suite
- Enhanced test mocks for improved reliability
- Better test coverage for trace logging functionality
