3. Click "Unregister" on any existing service workers
4. Go to Storage ‚Üí Clear site data
5. Hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

Open DevTools ‚Üí Console and verify:

- [ ] No `add-to-cache-list-conflicting-entries` errors
- [ ] No `MutationObserver` errors
- [ ] No 404 errors for brand assets
- [ ] No "preloaded but not used" warnings

   - Safari: Share ‚Üí Add to Home Screen

2. Verify in Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Manifest:
   - [ ] Icon at 192x192 shows no size warnings
   - [ ] Icon at 512x512 shows no size warnings
   - [ ] "Installability" section shows "Page is installable"

3. Install the app and verify:
   - [ ] App icon appears correctly
   - [ ] App launches in standalone mode

   - [ ] No dark mode flash on load
   - [ ] No localStorage errors in console

### Brand Assets Test

## üîß Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found after deployment:

### Option 1: Quick Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
# (depends on your hosting platform)
```

### Option 2: Emergency Patches

If service worker is causing issues:

1. Deploy a version with `VitePWA` disabled in `vite.config.ts`
2. Users will need to hard refresh to get the new version

If icons are broken:

1. Revert icon files to previous versions
2. Rebuild and deploy

If theme flash persists:

1. Check localStorage key matches between `index.html` and `main.tsx`
2. Consider setting inline style on `<html>` tag as backup

## üìä Success Metrics

After 24 hours, check:

### Error Rate

- [ ] Console error rate decreased by 60%+ (from ~8-12 errors to ~1-2)
- [ ] Zero Workbox precache errors
- [ ] Zero 404 errors for brand assets

### PWA Metrics

- [ ] PWA install prompt appears for eligible users
- [ ] PWA install success rate > 80%
- [ ] No icon size warnings in production

### User Experience

- [ ] Tour completion rate stable or improved
- [ ] No increase in support tickets about missing assets
- [ ] Theme switching works correctly

## üêõ Known Edge Cases

### Service Worker Caching

Some users may have old service workers cached. They will need to:

1. Close all tabs of the app
2. Wait 24 hours (service worker auto-updates)
   OR
3. Manually clear cache and reload

### Safari PWA Icons

Safari may cache old icon sizes. Users may need to:

1. Remove app from home screen
2. Clear Safari cache
3. Re-install PWA

### Private Mode

Theme preference won't persist in private/incognito mode (expected behavior)
