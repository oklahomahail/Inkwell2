# Authentication Flow Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The authentication flow was broken because magic links were incorrectly redirecting users to `/sign-in` instead of `/auth/callback`, causing the session exchange to fail and users to be stuck in an infinite "Signing you in..." loop.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Consistent Redirect Parameters**
   - Updated AuthForm.tsx to use `next` parameter consistently (previously using `redirect`)
   - Ensured AuthCallback.tsx handles multiple parameter names (`next`, `redirect`, and `view`)
2. **Parameter Naming Standardization**
   - All code paths now use the same parameter naming convention
   - Magic links consistently redirect to `/auth/callback?next=...`
3. **Supabase Configuration**
   - Verified and updated Site URL in Supabase Dashboard
   - Added `/auth/callback` as a whitelisted redirect URL in Supabase Dashboard
   - Updated SUPABASE_AUTH_CHECKLIST.md to reflect these changes

4. **Routing**
   - Confirmed that `/auth/callback` is a public route not protected by RequireAuth
   - Confirmed route exists in App.tsx outside of protected routes

5. **Web Manifest**
   - Confirmed the manifest is served with the correct Content-Type header
   - Confirmed the manifest is excluded from catch-all rewrites in vercel.json
   - Verified the manifest link in index.html has the correct crossorigin attribute

## Testing Instructions

1. **Magic Link Flow**
   - Request a magic link
   - Click the link in your email
   - Verify you land on `/auth/callback` momentarily
   - Verify you're redirected to `/dashboard` (or the intended destination) without looping
   - Verify you're properly signed in

2. **Web Manifest**
   - Visit `/site.webmanifest` directly
   - Verify it returns valid JSON with the correct content-type
   - Check browser console for any manifest errors on auth pages

## Additional Notes

- The AuthCallback component is robust, handling multiple auth flows:
  - Modern code flow (`?code=...`)
  - Legacy token flow (`?token_hash=...&type=...`)
  - Hash-based implicit flow (`#access_token=...&refresh_token=...`)
  - Type-only flow for email verification
- Ensure the Supabase dashboard URL configuration matches the production domain
- Double-check that all required URLs are in the Redirect URLs list in Supabase Dashboard
