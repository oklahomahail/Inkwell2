## Coverage Improvements

### Before Comprehensive Tests

- Estimated baseline: ~55-60% overall coverage
- claudeService: ~65% coverage
- snapshotService: ~60% coverage
- storageHealth: ~70% coverage

### After Comprehensive Tests

- **Overall: 72.31%** (+12-17 percentage points)
- **claudeService: 80%** (+15 percentage points)
- **snapshotService: 87.5%** (+27.5 percentage points)

## Priority Action Items

### High Priority

1. **Fix remaining 7 test failures** (1.17% failure rate)
2. **messageService.ts** - Only 14% coverage, critical for app functionality
3. **ThemeProvider.tsx** - 35% coverage, impacts user experience
4. **ExportModal.tsx** - 42% coverage, key feature

### Medium Priority

5. **imageService.ts** - 49% coverage
6. **svgCapture.ts** - 30% coverage
7. **dbFactory.ts** - 25% coverage
8. **schemaVersion.ts** - 50% coverage

### Low Priority (Above Target)

- Most services are at or near 70%+
- Focus on edge cases and branch coverage for existing tests

---

## Testing Standards Established

1. **Comprehensive Test Suites**: Focus on real-world scenarios, not just unit tests
2. **Error Handling**: All critical error paths tested
3. **Persistence & Cleanup**: Verify data lifecycle from creation to deletion
4. **Singleton Pattern**: Tests adapted for service singletons
5. **Fake Timers**: Use `vi.advanceTimersToNextTimer()` to avoid infinite loops
6. **Storage Mocking**: Proper localStorage and QuotaExceeded error testing

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete P1: Fix singleton teardown issues (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ Complete P2: Fix auto-snapshot timer tests (DONE)
3. ‚è≥ P3: Create test-coverage-summary.md (THIS FILE)
4. ‚è≥ P4: Merge docs into unified TESTING_GUIDE.md
5. ‚úÖ P5: Run coverage report and verify 70%+ global (DONE - 72.31%)
