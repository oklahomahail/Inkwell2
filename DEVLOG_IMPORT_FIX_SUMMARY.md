# devLog Import Path Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
- Files were importing `devLog` from incorrect paths (`src/utils/devLogger` instead of the correct location)
- Some files were using named imports `{ devLog }` instead of default imports
- Some files were calling `devLog()` as a function instead of using its methods
- Import paths were using `src/` prefix which didn't work with Vite's build process

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Export Structure Fixed
- **File**: `src/utils/devLogger.ts`
  - Added both named export (`export const devLog`) and default export (`export default devLog`)
  - This is the actual implementation file

- **File**: `src/utils/devLog.ts`  
  - Already had default export of `devLog` object
  - This is the public API file that re-exports from devLogger

### 2. Import Path Corrections
- Replaced all imports from `src/utils/devLogger` → `@/utils/devLog`
- Replaced all imports from `src/utils/devLog` → `@/utils/devLog` (for Vite compatibility)
- **Total files updated**: 80+ files

### 3. Import Syntax Fixed
- Changed named imports `import { devLog }` to default imports `import devLog`
- Files affected:
  - `src/tour/adapters/analyticsAdapter.ts`
  - `src/components/Onboarding/hooks/useSpotlightAutostartHardened.ts`
  - `src/components/Navigation/HelpMenu.tsx`
  - `src/components/Onboarding/tour-core/TourController.ts`

### 4. Function Call Patterns Fixed
- Replaced `devLog(...)` function calls with `devLog.debug(...)` method calls
- `devLog` is an object with methods (debug, warn, error, log, trace), not a callable function

## Files Modified

### Core utility files:
- `src/utils/devLogger.ts` - Added exports
- `src/utils/devLog.ts` - Already correct

### Files with import/usage fixes:
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/tour/adapters/analyticsAdapter.ts`
- `src/components/Onboarding/hooks/useSpotlightAutostartHardened.ts`
- `src/components/Navigation/HelpMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/Onboarding/tour-core/TourController.ts`
- Plus 74+ other files with automated path corrections

## Verification Results

✅ **No files importing from `devLogger`** - All imports now use correct `@/utils/devLog` path  
✅ **TypeScript compilation** - No errors (0 issues)  
✅ **Production build** - Successful (built in 9.55s)  
✅ **ESLint** - Only expected console warnings in dev utility files  
✅ **Import consistency** - All 80+ files using standardized `@/utils/devLog` path  

## Key Decisions

1. **Why `@/utils/devLog` instead of `src/utils/devLog`?**
   - Vite only recognizes the `@/` alias configured in `vite.config.ts`
   - TypeScript accepts both due to `baseUrl: "."`, but Vite build needs the alias

2. **Why keep both `devLogger.ts` and `devLog.ts`?**
   - `devLogger.ts` contains the implementation
   - `devLog.ts` serves as the public API with additional utilities
   - Maintains separation of concerns

3. **Why default export instead of named export?**
   - 80+ files in codebase were already using default import syntax
   - More concise: `import devLog` vs `import { devLog }`
   - Consistent with project patterns

## Commands Used

```bash
# Find incorrect imports
git grep -n "from.*devLogger"

# Replace import paths (automated)
find src -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" \) \
  -exec perl -i -pe 's|from "src/utils/devLog"|from "@/utils/devLog"|g' {} \;

# Replace function calls
perl -i -pe 's/\bdevLog\(/devLog.debug(/g' [files...]

# Verify fixes
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All devLog imports are now:
- Using the correct path (`@/utils/devLog`)
- Using default import syntax
- Using proper method calls (`.debug()`, `.warn()`, etc.)
- Passing TypeScript type checking
- Building successfully in production
