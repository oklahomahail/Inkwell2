# Vercel pnpm Lockfile Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem

Vercel deployment was failing with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` error:

- `pnpm-lock.yaml` was generated with pnpm 10.x (lockfileVersion: '10.0')
- `package.json` declared `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.12.0"`
- Vercel runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` which requires exact version alignment

## Root Cause

Version skew between:

- **Lockfile format**: Created by pnpm 10.x
- **Declared version**: pnpm@9.12.0 in package.json
- **Vercel expectation**: Frozen lockfile with matching version

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Regenerated Lockfile with Correct Version

```bash
# Removed old lockfile generated by pnpm 10.x
rm pnpm-lock.yaml

# Regenerated with current pnpm 9.12.0 (matching package.json)
pnpm install
```

### 2. Fixed Missing Dependency

```bash
# Added back @sentry/react which was missing from package.json
pnpm add @sentry/react
```

### 3. Version Alignment Verified

- ✅ **Local pnpm**: 9.12.0
- ✅ **package.json**: `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.12.0"`
- ✅ **Lockfile version**: `lockfileVersion: '9.0'`
- ✅ **Node version**: 22.x (matches `engines.node`)

### 4. Added `.nvmrc` for Consistency

Created `.nvmrc` with `22` to ensure Node version consistency across environments.

## Files Changed

- `package.json` - Added `@sentry/react` dependency
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Regenerated with pnpm 9.x format
- `.nvmrc` - Added for Node version consistency

## Verification Steps

```bash
# Verify versions align
pnpm -v          # 9.12.0
node -v          # v22.x.x

# Test installation works
pnpm install     # ✅ Success

# Test frozen lockfile (Vercel simulation)
rm node_modules
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile  # ✅ Should work on Vercel now
```

## Next Steps for Vercel

1. **Deploy**: Push these changes to trigger Vercel deployment
2. **Verify**: Check Vercel build logs show successful `pnpm install`
3. **Remove temporary workarounds**: If any `--no-frozen-lockfile` flags were added

## Prevention for Future

- Always regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` when changing `packageManager` in package.json
- Use `corepack` to manage pnpm versions consistently
- Consider adding CI check to verify lockfile/package.json alignment

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The lockfile mismatch is fixed and Vercel deployments should now succeed with the frozen lockfile check.
