# PWA Manifest and Auth Flow Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### PWA Manifest Delivery

- Fixed `/site.webmanifest` delivery by excluding it from the SPA catch-all in `vercel.json`
- Added proper Content-Type header configuration for webmanifest files
- Validated PWA icon paths and accessibility
- Ensured manifest is properly referenced in `index.html` with correct crossorigin

### Authentication Flow

- Fixed auth redirect loop issues (sign-in → dashboard → sign-in)
- Cleaned up `_once=1` URL parameter usage
- Improved session hydration and redirect logic in RequireAuth component
- Updated `isPublicRoute` in `src/utils/auth.ts` to use strict equality for auth routes
- Eliminated race conditions in auth redirects

### MutationObserver Hardening

- Added SSR and Node environment checks in tour/onboarding components:
  - `src/components/Onboarding/hooks/useSpotlightAutostart.ts`
  - `src/tour/targets.ts`
  - `src/components/Onboarding/selectorMap.ts`
- Used requestAnimationFrame for safer DOM operations

### Testing

- Added/fixed tests for PWA manifest headers
- Fixed RequireAuth test mocking issue
- Validated AuthPage test

## Verification

- All unit tests passing (vitest)
- Manual verification needed using the QA_CHECKLIST.md

## After Deployment

- May need to purge Vercel cache if old behavior persists
- Verify PWA installation works on desktop/mobile
- Verify authentication flows in production environment
